# Fish ID App How To Use
## 1. Take pictures of fish
Put them onto the harddrive, use one folder per day and dive/snorkel site.<br>
This app only works with pictures (jpg & png). If you have a video, I recommend making a screenshot and using that picture.

## 2. Start App
Use the link "Start FishID" on the desktop. Alternatively, run launch_app.R in RStudio.


## 3. Specify Setup of Entry (Folder, Date and Dive/Snorkel Site)
Choose the folder with pictures via the button "Choose Folder".
Usually they are stored on the harddrive (called DataDir) in "Marine Obersavtions (Snorkel and Dive) dates" - folder
For the case that no harddrive is available, you can switch to the local User Directory (called UserDir) via the dropdown menu in the upper right.<br>
Furthermore, specify the day, month, year and snorkel/dive site.<br>
These settings **will remain the same for all entries**! If you want to do another folder, just restart the app.<br>
When finished, click the button "Confirm Setup". This might take a while, since the app needs to load all pictures!

## 4. Make an Entry
Note: You can make the picture larger or smaller by hovering over the corners/edges.<br>
Date, snorkel/dive site and reference folder are automatically set by the input in point 3.<br>
Enter either Species or Common Name, the other one + the Fish Group will be autocompleted!<br>
Rename the picture according to the scientific name.<br>
When all relevant fields are filled out, click button "Save entry". The app will do two things:<br>
- Your entry will be saved in the Excel-database, so there is no need to touch Excel during the whole process!
- The picture will be renamed in the folder to your choosen name. If the choosen name already exists, there will be **no** new entry and the file is not renamed! Please choose another name!
<br>
You can browse through all pictures in the folder via the previous and next buttons.
Generally, if the picture name is already the scientific name, this fish has already been entered into the database!<br>
If you are finished, you may just close the app.
